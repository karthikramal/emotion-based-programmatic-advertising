**Developing a Model for Cross-Functional Teams to Understand Customers' Interests in a Web-Cookie-Less Environment Within Digital Media Sector (Onscreen real-time data synthetics).**

Abstract: 
Digital marketing has become a tough sector to operate in the current cookie-less world. Businesses are now more reliant on the first-party cookie data that is implemented on their websites. This has become an obstacle for the digital media tech companies to effectively cater their platforms to better serve their advertisers and users. More than anyone, digital media tech companies such as Meta and TikTok are hurt by the absence of user trackers on the currently available devices and applications. Therefore, we have invented a model that helps digital media giants, advertisers, and users engage in the digital marketing sector effectively and efficiently. The solution is to harvest users’ emotions and situations through a 100 percent privacy-based mechanism rather than heavily relying on third-party cookies. The solution will help the tech giants and advertisers target their potential clients based on just the two primary key points.

Brief: 
Our model consists of two sectors, which are the digital media tech companies such as social media networks and the companies that advertise on the digital walls. Digital media tech companies include the users of their platform, which are also the customers to whom the companies will target their advertisements. This model will be implemented by the digital media tech companies on their sides and will assist the advertisers in targeting their potential customers based on two sets of information.

The scenario on Facebook: 
We will implement an algorithm on the Facebook application. When a customer interacts with a post for at least 3 seconds, the algorithm will select that post based on the user’s interest. The post will have two sections: a title (text) and an image or video. The algorithm will use its inbuilt Recognition AI and will study the title and recognize the content available in the image or video. These potential data will then be sent to the generative AI, predictive AI, and LLM to deliver the output, which will have two sets of information (primary target points): 1) Emotion 2) Situation. This extract will then be sent to the centralized AD database.
Once the emotion and situation are captured by a customer, this customer will be added to a classified customer group, which is the general group for all similar types of customers (with the same emotions and situations).

100 percent privacy: 
Once the customer is added to a classified group linked to a particular emotion and situation, the appropriate ads linked to those particular emotions and situations will be displayed to that respective user or customer. No parties involved in this ecosystem can track the personal-level details of the customer apart from the classified group label.
However, the time period for the availability of the particular user's or customer’s label in the specified classified customer group has to go through an in-depth study to be determined. This will be an opportunity for future research.

Cross-functional teams: 
On the other hand, the company will cater its digital marketing campaigns specifically targeting their potential customers based on their real-time emotions and situations. To cater to digital marketing campaigns, we strongly believe that a cross-functional team must lead the show rather than a conventional marketing team. Because digital marketing has become an integral part of our business ecosystem, it is more than a sales tool or an awareness tool. It's a prestige and a brand for corporations in today’s modern world. To take this battle up, the cross-functional team is the only capable segment that is equipped with multivariate skills, expertise, and backgrounds that will be helpful in understanding comprehensive customer insights aligned with their products’ potential. Therefore, in our particular model, we recommend that a cross-functional team include at least an individual from each of the departments mentioned below:
/n Marketing: To extract market-related information
/n Product Development: To understand product insights
Finance: To understand the financial aspects of the company and its customers
Sales: To integrate historical sales data
Customer Experience: To understand the customer problems
Creative: To understand the designs attractive to potential customers
Copywriting: To create ad copies, especially for potential customers
Retail network: To integrate retail data
Partners: To understand their perspectives on the potential customers
Psychology experts: To understand and identify csutomers' pain points, interests, and psychology
& Customers: To directly understand the customers and create customer journeys

Additionally, many pieces of information and data can be retrieved other than for the reasons mentioned here by including these departments in the development of modernized digital marketing campaigns.

The designing phase: 
The cross-functional team, with a comprehensive understanding of their customer insights, will design their ads using the three segments below:
Their potential target customers’ personal attributes.
Their potential target customers’ design interests.
Attractive content for their potential target customers.
 
Once the advertisements are developed, each ad will be linked to particular types of emotions and situations and will be uploaded to the Centralized AD database.

AD display: 
When the emotion and situation of a user or customer hits the centralized AD database, an appropriate advertisement linked to that particular emotion and situation will be displayed to that originating user or customer.

Optional target points: 
additional segments such as likes, shares, comments, and personal attributes can be used by the digital media tech companies to track customers. But our goal is to refrain from using these personal-level trackers to provide a digital world with only complete privacy-based mechanisms.

Future research:
Time available to a customer within a classified customer group.
Adding customer behaviour as a third primary target point.
Other departments can be helpful in understanding customers.
Customer psychology and product interests.
